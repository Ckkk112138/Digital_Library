    <string name="hp_demo">Vernon and Petunia Dursley, of Number Four Privet Drive (in Little Whinging, Surrey), are proud to say that they are perfectly normal. They are the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just don’t hold with such nonsense. Vernon is the director of a drill-making firm called Grunnings, and Petunia keeps house and raises their one-year-old son Dudley.</string>
